🌱 **Currently vibing with:** data analysis, data engineering, technical writing, and open-source projects. <br />
🛠️ **Tools I work with:** Whatever gets the job done + a huge chunk of curiosity!  <br />
📫 **How to reach me:** ufuoma.ejite@gmail.com <br />
😄 **Pronouns:** She/Her. <br />
⚡ **Fun fact:** My favorite debugging tool? A deep breath and a silent prayer.😎
