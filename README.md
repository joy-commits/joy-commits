### Hi there 👋

I'm Ufuoma from Nigeria, and I love doing "stuffs" with data (ranging from wrangling to EDA to creating beautiful vizzes and storytelling)! I really enjoy learning, as well as working on languages like Python (I enjoy pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy) and SQL. 

🔭 I’m currently working on this page <br />
🌱 I’m currently learning technical writing and machine learning <br />
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects <br />
🤔 I’m looking for data analyst roles and even technical writing roles too! <br />
🛠️ Tools I use: Python, SQL, MS Excel, GSheets, PowerBI <br />
📫 How to reach me: ufuomajoy27@gmail.com <br />
😄 Pronouns: She/Her <br />
⚡ Fun fact: I have a lovely voice😊
